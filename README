Application has been produced using a usb snoop tool on windows,
to look at the usb device while an application communicates with the
device. It has been working fine for me, but i cannot ensure the
safety of using this application over a longer period.

Brief introduction to functionality.
	- Status can be read live for all parameters,
	  INTERVAL, parameter set in windows application.
	  --------
	   history log saving uses the interval for moving to 
	   another memory location of the device, for storing active
	   readings.
	- All other parameters are shown when running the application
	  either with the -h option, or without any arguments.
	   

Current status:
	- basic reading of the weather station details
	- preliminary writing support, for resetting history log.
	- tested on Debian GNU/Linux 
	- Device gets claimed by the kernel usbhid driver, try running
	  this program as root if you have problems to give it 
	  permissions to detach the attached drivers on startup.
	- MySQL support for clean and neat data handling
	- CHMS project supports wwsr (contact oh1jty@toimii.net)
