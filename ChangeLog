Version 0.2 - <oh1jty@toimii.net>
	MySQL support added.
	Some code fixes and cleaning

Version 0.1
	Reading of all status functions available on the device.
	
	Issues found on the rain statistics, but it is read.
	reported numbers by the device on the lcd display does not
	match the data found in the data stream, which shows to increase
	when its raining (a little water bottle test was made).

	Experimental writing of resetting the buffer on the device,
	functionality has been tested, and shows that the buffer is
	reset. But option -z is used on your risk of loosing stored
	information gathered, as the reset will make the windows client
	software unable to read the logged entried.

	Captured information with Benoits USB Sniffer and
	converted it to C using lindi's usbsnoop2libusb.pl script.
